# OpenContentTemplates (_Razor-based_) for OpenContent on DNN

These are templates that we commonly use for various projects. This repository replaces [the previous one which used Handlebars](https://github.com/UpendoVentures/OpenContentTemplates), instead of Razor.

Learn more about DNN CMS at [the official DNN community website](https://dncommunity.org).

**IMPORTANT:** Using the Mandeeps Porto theme is NOT a requirement.
